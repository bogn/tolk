# The UnobtrusiveYAMLColumn serializer in contrast to ActiveRecord::Coders::YAMLColumn doesn't serialize
# UTF-8 characters in their Hex byte representation. Instead it serializes the char itself (e.g. Ã© instead of \xC3\xA9).
# A likely reason ActiveRecord::Coders::YAMLColumn is doing this is to achieve maximum compatibility.
# This module is for cases where it's more important to have the actual characters in their end form in the DB which
# saves a consumer of this DB from having to convert the hex literals. This is useful for situations where other
# programming languages work with Tolk's translations through the database.
#
# Furthermore it'll use .ya2yaml(:syck_compatible => true) instead of YAML.dump if it can.
# ya2yaml will generate lighter YAML markup. For example it won't end multi-line values with \ for each line.
#
# The expansion of UTF-8 hex literals was inspired by
